- Format: CSV  
- Records: 180,000+ rows  
- Columns: 50+ variables  

A new working table was created using SQL by selecting and transforming only the relevant columns required for the analysis.


### Key Variables

- order_id  
- days_for_shipping_real  
- days_for_shipment_scheduled  
- late_delivery_risk  
- delivery_status  
- shipping_mode  
- category_name  
- order_region  
- order_country / customer_country  
- order_date  
- shipping_date  


### Data Scope

- Time period analyzed: 2015–2017  

The dataset includes data for 2018; however, it contains only one month of records.  
Therefore, the analysis focuses on the years 2015–2017 to ensure consistent and comparable insights.


### Data Credibility (ROCCC)

- **Reliable:** Large dataset suitable for analysis  
- **Original:** Sourced from a recognized data repository (Kaggle / Mendeley)  
- **Comprehensive:** Covers multiple aspects of supply chain operations  
- **Current:** Contains sufficient historical data for trend analysis  
- **Cited:** Widely used in supply chain research  


### Data Limitations

- The dataset represents a single company (DataCo Global)  
- Some variables may not fully capture operational complexity  
- The dataset is historical and may not reflect current conditions

## Process Phase

Data cleaning and transformation were performed using SQL (BigQuery) to prepare the dataset for analysis.

### Data Preparation Steps

- Created a new working table by selecting and retaining only the relevant columns  
- Checked for missing values in key fields and confirmed data completeness  
- Standardized categorical fields using TRIM() and UPPER() to ensure formatting consistency  
- Verified that date and numeric fields were correctly formatted using the schema  
- Reviewed shipping duration fields (real vs scheduled) to ensure logical values  

- Verified duplicate records:
  - Several records were identified with the same order_id  
  - Upon investigation, these records represent multiple items within a single order rather than duplicate errors  
  - Therefore, they were retained to preserve data accuracy  

**Result:** The final dataset is clean, structured, and ready for analysis.  

**Note:** SQL queries used for data cleaning and analysis are available in the `/sql` folder.
## Analyze Phase

The analysis focuses on key delivery-related metrics to identify patterns of late deliveries and evaluate performance across regions, shipping modes, and product categories over the period 2015–2017.

### Key Insights

- Out of approximately 178K orders, 54.81% are delivered late, while only 17.84% are delivered on time and 23.05% arrive early (advanced).  
- The cancellation rate remains very low, indicating strong customer retention despite service delays.  

**Insight:** This highlights a significant imbalance in delivery performance, where late deliveries dominate the system.


- Late delivery rates remain relatively stable across 2015–2017, showing no significant improvement over time.  

- Central Africa records one of the highest delay rates (~57.96%), consistently across the three-year period, highlighting persistent regional inefficiencies.  

- First Class shipping shows the highest exposure to delays across all three years, indicating underperformance of premium shipping services.  


### Shipping Performance Gap

Significant gaps exist between scheduled and actual delivery times across shipping modes:

- **Second Class:** Scheduled for 2 days, actual delivery averages ~3.99 days, resulting in a high late rate (~85.56%)  
- **Same Day:** Scheduled for 0 days, actual average ~0.48 days, but the target is missed 72.57% of the time  
- **Standard Class:** The only mode where scheduled (4 days) aligns with actual delivery time, resulting in the lowest delay rate  

**Insight:** This indicates inefficiencies in delivery planning and execution.  
**Insight:** The logistics system is optimized for high-volume, low-speed delivery, while faster shipping options are not reliably supported.


### Category-Level Insights

- Golf Bags & Carts (68.85% late, low volume) suggest issues related to bulky or non-standard items  
- High-volume categories such as Cameras (58% late) indicate internal processing limitations  

- Categories with higher average benefit per order tend to fall within the high-profit / high-risk zone  

**Insight:** This creates a risk to both customer satisfaction and long-term business performance.  


### System-Wide Observation

- The overall late delivery rate reaches 54.81%, and most categories perform close to this level  

**Insight:** This indicates that delays are not limited to specific categories but are widespread across the system.  


### Profitability vs Performance

- Profitability shows a slight increase, while delivery performance remains unchanged  

**Insight:** This indicates a misalignment between business growth and operational efficiency.  


### Overall Conclusion

The consistently high delay rates across regions, shipping modes, and product categories indicate that the issue is systemic rather than localized.
